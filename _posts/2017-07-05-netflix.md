<em>If you liked this, you might also like that.</em>  
<br>
All of us have stumbled upon this phrase on the internet. And sometimes it is true and sometimes totally wrong. 
While many people are very critical about the vast amount of data collected by various companies (and I must confess, it is a little creepy from time to time), in general I appreciate that my user behavior is watched.  

<h2>Big data is changing the world</h2>
Data collection, recommendations, systems changed because of user preferences, questionnaires, likes, dislikes... We have always been forced to make a statement on whether we like something or not and the market has responded to new demands. The only thing that has dramatically changed during time is the way we communicate what we want, from a direct and personal way in the past to an unknowing, impersonal way of communication. It seems as if we lost control on our own internet-personality. And hand in hand with this development also the amount of information has dramatically changed. But tech-companies took up this challenge early on and tried to find solutions to big-data related problems. But, to make it easier to understand, the main question of companies dealing with user data was and still is:   
<br>
<em>How can we make use of these data?</em>  

<br>
Almost every business is affected from this rapid development. And it is no surprise that world-famous tech-heros like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple or Uber are on the leading front of the big-data revolution. They are dealing with these kind of data since their beginnnings and try to develop new tools and algorithms. One cannot ignore how these companies changed the world.   

<h2>Netflix rent DVD´s?</h2>
With their worldwide-launch in 2016 Netflix, one of the internet television giants, is now also one of these global players, even if they are only changing the way we are being entertained. Think about the process classic television has undergone in the last two decades. Actually there is not that much process. That is why the idea of internet television was in some kind revolutionary. And Netflix is one of those companies that understood very early that the key to success lies in going from offline to online. Wait. Netflix has a offline past? Yes, they have! 
Netflix was actually founded 20 years ago as a DVD-renting company in the US. The major problem they encountered during their first years was, that they were not able to deliver or store the most recent blockbuster to every single user. So, they tried to change their system and thought about a way to stand out from the crowd. And they found a clever way. They started introducing a recommendation system to their customers, based on availability, genres and more features, they took into account. And surprisingly people liked it. From that point on, Netflix asked users about their preferences and collected data, therefore improving the recommendations for the next movie to be rent. The fact that Netflix nowadays is impressivly successfull with more than <strong>100 million subscribers</strong> is closely tied to tremendous improvements of the recommendation algorithm.  
But why is it even important? Let´s do a simple experiment! Think about any movie or a TV-show you want to watch in this very moment. What will it be?
<br>
<form action="https://google.com/search" method="get" target="_blank">
<input type="hidden" name="sitesearch" />
<input type="textarea" name="q" rows = "1" autofocus style="width:100%;height:100%;"/>
</form>
<br>


Actually it is quite hard to think of anything special. At least for me. So, I really appreciate Netflix´s way to suggest content and apparently many others do: 70% of what people watch on Netflix is based on their recommendation algorithm. That´s a lot.  

<h2>How does it work and why is Netflix so good at it?</h2>
