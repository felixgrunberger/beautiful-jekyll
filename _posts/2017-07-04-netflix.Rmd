<em>If you liked this, you might also like that.</em>  
All of us have stumbled upon this phrase on the internet. And sometimes it is true and sometimes totally wrong. 
While many people are very critical about the vast amount of data collected by various companies (and I must confess, it is a little creepy from time to time), in general I appreciate that my user behavior is watched.  
Data collection, recommendations, systems changed because of user preferences, questionnaires, likes, dislikes... We have always been forced to make a statement on whether we like something or not and the market has responded to new demands. The only thing that has dramatically changed during time is the way we communicate what we want, from a direct and personal way in the past to an unknowing, impersonal way of communication. And with this development also the amount of information has dramatically changed and it is now much more challenging to deal with this problems. But, to make it easier to understand, the main question of companies dealing with user data was and still is:   
<em>How can we make use of those data?</em>  
Almost every business is affected from this rapid development. And it is no surprise that tech-companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple or Uber are on the leading front of the big-data development. They are dealing with these kind of data since their beginnnings and try to develop new tools and algorithms, which find their way into practical application or can be used in research.  

With their worldwide-launch in 2016 Netflix, one of the internet television giants, is now also one of these global players. If you think about the way classic television has changed within the last decade, you will soon realize, that actually they did not change that much. Commercials are getting longer and longer, the program not more appealing and for high resolution programs you have to pay. The idea of internet television was to watch whatever, whenever you want. And Netflix is one of those companies that understood very early that the key in their success is in going from offline to online. Wait. Netflix was a offline business? Yes, they were! 
Netflix was actually founded 20 years (!) ago as a DVD-renting company in the US. The major problem they had during that time was, that they were not able to deliver or store always the most recent blockbuster everybody wanted to see. So, they tried to change their system and thaught about a way to stand out from the crowd. And they found a clever way. They started to introduce a recommendation system to their customers, based on availability, genres and more features, they took into account. And surprisingly people liked it. recommending DVDs to their customers, which were available at warehouses nearby, in that way optimizing a lot of things. And it worked.
