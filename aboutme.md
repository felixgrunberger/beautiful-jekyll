I obtained my BSc and MSc in <strong>Biology</strong> from the University of Regensburg. During my master thesis, dealing with protein-protein interactions, I tried to improve both my molecular and bioinformatical skills.

During my course of studies I became interested in bioinformatics and finished an extracurricular IT training offered by the University (bash scripting, C++, Python). At the end of last year, working on genomics in archaea, I switched from using my basic-level skills in Python to [R](https://www.r-project.org). During the ongoing project I forced myself to write reproducible scripts with packages from the [tidy data universe](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) and learn how to build web apps with [Shiny R](https://shiny.rstudio.com).

IÂ´ very easily bored, so my interests are broad. Sports, HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT for fun (look at this blog...), photography (all pictures on the blog by myself), etc.
