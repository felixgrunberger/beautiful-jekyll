  Hi, I´m Felix and I´m 29 years old.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
  Currently I am a PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.uni-r.de/index.html.en">University of Regensburg</a> pursuing a Phd in <strong>Biology</strong>, working on gene regulatory networks in archaea. 
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I obtained my BSc and MSc in <strong>Biology</strong> from the University of Regensburg. During my master thesis, dealing with protein-protein interactions, I tried to improve both my molecular and bioinformatical skills. 
</p>

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
During my course of studies I became interested in bioinformatics and finished an extracurricular IT training offered by the University (bash scripting, C++, Python). At the end of last year, working on genomics in archaea, I switched from using my basic-level skills in Python to <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.r-project.org">R</a>. During the ongoing project I forced myself to write reproducible scripts with packages from the <a target="_blank" href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html">tidy data universe</a> and learn how to build interactive (and pretty) web apps with <a target="_blank" href = "https://shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny R</a>.
</p>

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I´m very easily bored, so my interests are broad. Sports, HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT for fun (look at this blog...), photography (all pictures on the blog by myself), etc. 
</p>

I´m excited about running my first marathon in Berlin this year.
